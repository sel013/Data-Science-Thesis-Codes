# Data-Science-Thesis-Codes
This repository contains all the code used for my thesis project on forecasting electricity consumption at the regional level in France. In this work, i compare three models (LSTM, GRU, and XGBoost) across four prediction horizons: 1-hour, 8-hour, 1-day, and 7-day ahead.
